Here is the description of the most tricky material parameters. Most parameters are named according to what they do to the material, but some require a more detailed explanation.


Main Parameters:

Final Power - Final brightness (Emission Power) of the image, you need to lower this value if you using the “Gamma Rendering” Mode.
Normal Texture - Normal texture of a mesh, materials can be used without it.
Normal Amount - How much normal texture will apply to the effect.


Rim Parameters:

Rim Add Or Multiply - Control the behavior of the Rim mask.
Rim Exp and Rim Exp2 2 - Control the smoothness of the Rim mask.


Rim Noise Parameters:

Rim Noise Texture - Noise texture, used for Rim mask.
Rim Noise Tiling - Tiling of the noise texture.
Rim Noise CA - Chromatic Aberration parameters of noise texture, useful only when Rim is set to Add.
Rim Noise Distortion - Second noise mask texture for more distortion.
Rim Noise Spherize - Rim will use spherical normals, set the local center position with the Rim Noise Spherize Position parameter.


Eta Parameters:

Eta - IOR (Intex of Refraction) parameter, control how much of refraction applied to the background space texture.
Eta Fresnel Exp - Multiply the refraction by Rim mask and control its smoothness.
Eta AA Edges Fix - Fixing edges artifacts when using with low-quality anti-aliasing, like FXAA.


Background Textures Parameters:

Rotation Axis - Axis of rotation for background textures.
Rotation - If the rotation speed is set to 0, you can manually rotate each of the three textures.
Stars - Base background texture with a minimal amount of controls.
Clouds - Emissive Nebula Clouds texture, you can control the color and the emissive power of it.
Dark Clouds - Darkening Nebula Clouds texture, have many parameters for controlling the edge glow and power of emission.
